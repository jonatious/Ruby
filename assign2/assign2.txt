Assign2 Due 11:59PM June 22

Write a Ruby program using Active Records (no rails in this assignment) to do the following:

In this assignment we will create Ruby code that makes use of Active Records. 
Create a class that will interact with active records models. The models we 
use will represent workers and work orders. 

Start by uncommenting one test at a time and implement minimum code to make 
all uncommented tests pass. The following are a good sequence of test suites 
to work with:

worker_test
work_orders_test
manage_workers_test

Total [100]: 99
All tests pass [30]:
Worker [20]:
WorkOrder [20]:
ManageWorkers [20]:
Overall quality [10]: -1
Place all the validates first, then belongs_to
