Write a Ruby program that will display the stock information for several 
tickers. The input will come from a file which contains a list of ticker symbols, one per line. You may obtain the stock information from 
<http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=SYMBOL> where SYMBOL may be any valid ticker symbol like GOOG, AAPL, etc.

The program should read the file, issue requests to the webservice, parse the 
result, and display, in sorted order of the ticker symbol the latest price for the ticker.

Format of output:

Ticker	Price
...		  ...
...		  ...
...		  ...
...		  ...
...		  ...
...		  ...
...		  ...
...		  ...
...		  ...
