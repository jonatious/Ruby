Assign3 Due 11:59PM June 29

In this assignment we will create a Rails application with the following details:

WorkStatus: There will be no controller for this. It will be pre-populated with seed data of values Created, Assigned, Completed.

Work: This will have a name and a WorkStatus. The WorkStatus will automatically be assigned to Created when Work is created.

Worker: has first name, last name. Two workers can have the same first name.
Two workers may have the same last name. No two workers may have the same 
first name and last name.

The controller for workers will list all workers and provide a way to add a new worker.

The show link for a worker will take to the page for that worker. On this page list all the works assigned to the worker and also all works completed by the worker. When a work is clicked on, take to a page where the work can be reviewed.

Provide a way to assign a work to the worker. The list of work shown should only include works that are in the Created status.

Work review page. This page shows only one work. If it is in Created state, it can be assigned to a worker. If it is in assigned state, it can be completed. If it is in completed state, it can't be changed to any other state.
